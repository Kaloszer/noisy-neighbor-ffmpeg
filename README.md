## Because sometimes, peace and quiet is just a script away! üè†üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

Are your neighbors treating your walls like they're made of rubber? Is their idea of a lullaby a impromptu heavy metal concert at 3 AM? Fear not, weary apartment dweller! The Noisy Neighbor Compiler is here to turn those sleepless nights into concrete evidence.

## What's This All About?

This project is your ally in the ongoing struggle for peace and quiet. It takes your collection of "Noisy Neighbor's Greatest Hits" videos and compiles them into one comprehensive video ‚Äì perfect for when you need to prove that your upstairs neighbor is actually running a 24/7 indoor trampoline park.

### Key Features:

- üé¨ Compiles multiple video clips into one comprehensive "noisy neighbor highlight reel"
- üîä Customizable noise threshold detection
- ‚è±Ô∏è Optional timestamp overlay (for when you need to prove that yes, they were indeed having a rave at 4:27 AM on a Tuesday)
- üß† Smart silence detection (it knows the difference between "peaceful quiet" and "the calm before the storm")

## How It Works

1. Place your evidence ("video clips") into the `input_videos` folder.
2. Run the script - it detects the noisiest parts of each video.
3. Sit back as it stitches together a compilation that would make any landlord take notice.
4. Use the resulting video to file your complaint, support your case, or simply as a modern art piece titled "Nocturnal Symphonies: A Study in Neighborly Disharmony".

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (as quietly as your neighbors are not).
2. Install the dependencies (you'll need ffmpeg and Bun).
3. Place your video files in the `input_videos` directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```
   bun run encode.js
   ```
5. For those who like their evidence timestamped:
   ```
   bun run encode.js --timestamp
   ```

## A Note on File Naming

To use the timestamp feature, name your input files like this:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-your-creative-file-name-here.mp4
```
Example: `2024-03-15-22-30-upstairs-neighbor-flamenco-practice.mp4`

Remember, in the game of noisy neighbors, when you play the long game, everybody wins. Except maybe the guy with the wall-shaking sound system. He might need to tone it down a bit. But that's kind of the point, isn't it? üòâ

Now go forth and reclaim your right to a good night's sleep!

## Usage

Run the script with the following optional flags:

- `--timestamp`: Add a timestamp to the video clips (default: false)
- `--threshold`: Set the silence detection threshold (default: '-60dB')
- `--bufferTime`: Set the buffer time in seconds (default: 4)

Example:
```
bun run encode.js --timestamp --threshold='-50dB' --bufferTime=3
```
These flags allow you to customize the behavior of the script:

- `--timestamp`: When set, adds a timestamp overlay to each clip.
- `--threshold`: Adjusts the silence detection sensitivity. A higher value (e.g., '-50dB') will detect more subtle sounds, while a lower value (e.g., '-70dB') will only detect louder sounds.
- `--bufferTime`: Sets the amount of time (in seconds) to include before and after each non-silent segment. This helps preserve context around the detected noise.
